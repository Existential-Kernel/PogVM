<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
  ## What is it?
    - PogVM (add acronym here) is a Virtual Machine written in C++. It's a hybrid between a RISC and CISC processor (or VRISC and VCISC technically speaking), 

  ## What can it do?
    - 


## Planning
  #### Why I chose a virtual machine as my project

  - language choice
      - The reason why I used C++ is because I figured it would be the best language for something as complex as a virtual machine. 
        Although I'm also fluent in javascript, C++ offers many features that are really useful when it comes to bulky system programs, and compiled languages are far better suited for a virtual machine than an interpreted language such as the aforementioned javascript, mainly because interpreted languages are generally slow (around 100x or 200x slower compared to a language like C). Although the slow nature of interpreted languages aren't usually visible with the naked eye at first glance, I've experienced the major drawbacks I've faced with creating large projects in the past due to how slow it has gradually become, even with optimisations. Because of this, I thought C++ would be the best choice before I started writting any code, and after finishing the project, I believe that was the best decision I could've made. 

    - C/C++ is good for CLIs

## How it works
  #### 


## Linux environment compatibility
  #### Decision of using linux
    - docker container
      - alpine linux
        - lightweight OS
        - easy to configure

## Difficulties
  #### Assembly in itself
    - x86-64 aspect
  #### Challenges of creating a VM

## Flowchart
  #### Image
    - create a flowchart image in photoshop or something idk
    - explain the flowchart

## Conclusion
