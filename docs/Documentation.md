# Introduction
    ## What is it?
      - PogCPU (add acronym here) is a virtual machine that executes x86-64 assembly code. It's a hybrid between a RISC and CISC processor (or VRISC and VCISC technically speaking), 

    ## Planning
      - Why I chose a virtual machine as my project

      - language choice
        - C++ is fast as fuck
        - C/C++ is good for CLIs

# Linux environment compatibility
    ## Decision of using linux
      - docker container
        - alpine linux
          - lightweight OS
          - easy to configure

# Difficulties
    ## Assembly in itself
      - x86 aspect

# Flowchart
    ## Image
      - create a flowchart image in photoshop or something idk
      - explain the flowchart

# Conclusion
