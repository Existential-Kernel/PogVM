<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
  ## What is it?
    - PogVM (add acronym here) is a Virtual Machine written in C++. It's a hybrid between a RISC and CISC processor (or VRISC and VCISC technically speaking), 

  ## What can it do?
    - 


## Planning
  #### Why I chose a virtual machine as my project

  - language choice
      - The reason why I used C++ is because I figured it would be the best language for something as complex as a virtual machine. 
        Although I'm also fluent in javascript, C++ offers many features that are really useful when it comes to bulky system programs, and compiled languages are far better suited for a virtual machine than an interpreted language such as javascript. 

    - C/C++ is good for CLIs


# Linux environment compatibility
    ## Decision of using linux
      - docker container
        - alpine linux
          - lightweight OS
          - easy to configure

# Difficulties
    ## Assembly in itself
      - x86-64 aspect
    ## Challenges of creating a VM

# Flowchart
    ## Image
      - create a flowchart image in photoshop or something idk
      - explain the flowchart

# Conclusion
