## Introduction
  #### What is it?
  - PogVM (note to myself: create an acronym for the name) is a virtual machine written in C++. It's a hybrid between a RISC and CISC processor or VRISC and VCISC technically speaking, and it's designed to run executable files from a cross platform perspective.


## Planning
  #### Explaining my choices in depth
  - My project choice

  #### Choices for 

  - language choice
    - The reason why I used C++ is because I figured it would be the best language for something as complex as a virtual machine. 
      Although I'm also fluent in JavaScript, C++ offers many features that are really useful when it comes to bulky system programs, and compiled languages are far better suited for a virtual machine than an interpreted language such as the aforementioned JavaScript, mainly because interpreted languages are generally slow (around 100x or 200x slower compared to a language like C for example). Although the slow nature of interpreted languages aren't usually visible with the naked eye at first glance, I've experienced the major drawbacks I've faced with creating large projects in the past due to how slow it has gradually become, even with optimisations. Because of this, I thought C++ would be the best choice before I started writing any code, and looking back after finishing the project, I believe that was the best decision I could've made.

  - Initial Intentions
    - When I started this project, I didn't exactly have a clear goal in mind in terms of the logic that operates the entire core of the project. Initially, I wanted to create a Virutal CPU because I thought it would be a fun project for myself (the project was previously named "PogCPU"), but as the CPU grew larger and larger, I figured it would be best to turn it into a virtual machine for the KAA programmig project that were months away from being announced.


## How it works
  #### 


## Linux environment compatibility
  #### Decision of using linux
    - docker container
      - alpine linux
        - lightweight OS
        - easy to configure

## Difficulties
  #### Assembly in itself
    - x86-64 aspect
  #### Challenges of creating a VM

## Flowchart
  #### Image
    - create a flowchart image in photoshop or something idk
    - explain the flowchart

## Conclusion
